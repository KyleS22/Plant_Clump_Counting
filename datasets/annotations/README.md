# README FOR THE "annotations" DATASET
Images from the  "protractor" (?). Called "annotations" because that is what the dataset was called on the original OneDrive &ndash; yes, this is somewhat confusing. 

Original dataset in "img", in TIFF image format. Converted to PNG by Castro-Zunti. Converted to 500x500 image patches by Castro-Zunti. Scripts used may be found in /object_detection/annotations .
